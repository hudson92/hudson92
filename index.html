                         <p>A web developer, digital marketer, and triathlete walk into a bar...
                    </p><br>
                    <p>That's not the start of a great joke but sums up my career so far. Starting out in digital marketing, I quickly took an interest in the more technical side of the job and particularly web design and development. All the while I have been pursuing a pretty strong career in amateur triathlon, including competing at World an European championships.</p> <br>
                    <p>Toe the Design comes from a common phrase to toe the line at the start of a race. I like to push my competitive edge into everything I do in my work and I believe it gives me that passionate edge when I become truly invested in projects. </p><br>
